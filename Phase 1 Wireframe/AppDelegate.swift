/** This file handles special UIApplication states including the following:
    
    applicationDidFinishLaunching: - handles on-startup configuration and construction
    applicationWillTerminate: - handles clean up at the end, when the application terminates
    Extraneous functionality should NOT be placed in the AppDelegate since they don't really belong there. This includes the following
        Document data -- this should be placed in a document manager singleton
        Button/table/view controllers, view delegate methods or other view handling (top-level view in applicationDidFinishLaunching: is still allowed) -- this work should be in respective view controller classes.
